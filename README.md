# Contactless Interactive Display for Surgeons :x::point_up::computer::syringe::pill::hocho::mask:

The basic idea behind this project is to create a display board for surgeons, which can be controlled
without touching it.

*Why surgeons?* -> Good question! :blush: Because they get their hands "dirty" and at the same time they need to look at
x-ray records, etc... about the patient so it would be nice if they could do that with only gestures on an
interactive display/board and they would not need to touch anything.
